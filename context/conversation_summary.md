# Conversation Summary - Strategic Insights

## Key Conversation Points

### Resume Transformation Strategy
**Problem**: Big Tech resume doesn't translate to startup appeal
**Solution**: Reframe as systems-level thinking and healthcare disruption focus

**Major Changes Made:**
- FDA role reframed as "Healthcare Systems Research" (market intelligence)
- All roles repositioned as building vs. consulting
- Healthcare trajectory shown as intentional career arc
- Metrics changed from deliverable completion to business impact
- Added healthcare exchange innovation as strategic project

### Real Motivation Revealed
**Quote**: "If I knew I couldn't fail I would build a private healthcare exchange bridging doctors with patients by having patients incorporate, pool liability and appear like any other corporation, collectively bargaining, deducting healthcare from taxes as overhead"

**Strategic Insight**: Rob's not looking for a job - he's looking for runway to build healthcare disruption. This changes the entire approach from "hire me" to "partner with me."

### AI-Washing Detection Framework (From Nate)
**Real AI Companies Have:**
- Engineering blogs about actual ML challenges (not ChatGPT integration)
- ML engineers >20% of team
- Open-source ML contributions
- Published papers/benchmarks
- Infrastructure costs >30% revenue
- Specific performance metrics

**Target Company Profile:**
- Series A-B stage (post-PMF, pre-scale)
- <200 employees (equity meaningful)
- Healthcare/B2B focus
- Seattle-based for culture fit
- Real technical moats, not AI-washing

### FDA Experience Repositioning
**Initial Framing**: "I got fired/quit after 7 months"
**Strategic Reframe**: "Embedded in federal systems to understand regulatory dysfunction and identify private sector opportunities"

**Key Value**: Rob understands FDA approval processes AND can spot government contracting dysfunction - valuable for healthcare startups navigating regulatory complexity.
