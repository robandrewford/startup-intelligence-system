## Immediate Usage Instructions

### First-Time Setup:
```bash
cd /Users/robertford/Repos/startup-intelligence-system
python setup.py  # Installs dependencies, creates database, validates config
```

### Daily Operations:
```bash
# Run discovery (20+ companies per day)
python main.py discover

# View top targets
python main.py analyze --top 10 --healthcare

# Generate visual dashboard
python dashboard.py
open data/outputs/dashboard.html

# Check system performance
python main.py stats --days 7
```

### Configuration:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add API keys (GitHub token recommended, others optional)
3. Configure PostgreSQL connection if not using local default

## Development Priorities

### Next Phase (Phase 2: Analysis Enhancement)
**High-impact features to implement:**

1. **Enhanced Crunchbase Integration**
   - Funding round details and investor networks
   - Competitive landscape mapping
   - Market timing assessment

2. **LinkedIn Employee Analysis**
   - Team composition and ML engineer ratios
   - Leadership background research
   - Growth trajectory assessment

3. **Real-time News Monitoring**
   - Funding announcement alerts
   - Product launch notifications
   - Outreach timing optimization

### Technical Debt to Address:
- LinkedIn scraper currently uses mock data (ToS compliance)
- Company deduplication could be more sophisticated
- GitHub analysis could include commit frequency patterns
- Geographic detection relies on text parsing

## Key Technical Insights

### AI-Washing Detection Algorithm:
Based on Nate's framework, scores companies 1-10 on authenticity:
- **Engineering Blog Analysis**: Technical depth vs. ChatGPT mentions
- **Job Posting Ratios**: ML engineers >20% of team
- **GitHub Contributions**: Custom ML repos vs. API wrapper projects  
- **Marketing Content**: Specific metrics vs. vague "AI-powered" claims

### Strategic Fit Scoring:
Optimized for Rob's target criteria:
- Healthcare relevance (FDA experience leverage)
- Seattle location (networking advantage)
- Series A-B stage (equity meaningful)
- Technical authenticity (no AI-washing)
- Team size 50-200 (leadership opportunity)

## Database Schema

### Core Tables:
- **companies**: Basic info, scores, discovery metadata
- **funding_rounds**: Investment data and investor tracking
- **company_intelligence**: GitHub analysis, technical assessments
- **discovery_runs**: Performance tracking and optimization metrics

### Key Indexes:
- AI-washing score (DESC) for quality filtering
- Strategic fit score (DESC) for targeting priority
- Healthcare relevance for vertical focus
- Location for geographic filtering

## API Dependencies

### Required:
- **GitHub API**: Organization analysis and ML contribution scoring
- **PostgreSQL**: Local or hosted database

### Optional (Enhances Functionality):
- **Crunchbase API**: Funding and investor data
- **LinkedIn**: Team composition analysis (use carefully)
- **HuggingFace**: Model download metrics
- **SendGrid**: Future outreach automation

## Success Metrics

### Discovery Efficiency:
- **Target**: 20+ qualified companies per week
- **Quality**: >80% Seattle-area, >60% AI-authentic
- **Performance**: <30 minutes daily discovery runtime

### Analysis Quality:
- **Strategic Fit**: Companies scoring 7+ correlate with interview opportunities  
- **AI-Washing Detection**: 85%+ accuracy filtering out integration-only companies
- **Healthcare Relevance**: Successful targeting of companies needing regulatory expertise

### Business Impact:
- **Time Optimization**: 80% strategic analysis vs. 20% data processing
- **Response Rates**: >15% response to targeted outreach (vs. 2% mass applications)
- **Interview Conversion**: Strategic targeting improves qualification rates

## Continuation Strategy

This system is **immediately productive** and will provide Rob with significant competitive advantage in his job search. The Phase 1 implementation addresses the core problem (AI-washing detection + strategic targeting) and subsequent phases will enhance efficiency and automation.

**Recommended development approach:**
1. **Use current system daily** to build company database and validate targeting
2. **Enhance based on results** - which companies respond, which criteria matter most
3. **Automate successful patterns** - turn manual analysis into algorithmic scoring
4. **Expand data sources** - add new discovery channels as they prove valuable

The system architecture supports this evolutionary approach with modular components and comprehensive configuration management.

## Important Notes for Continued Development

### Code Quality Standards:
- All async/await patterns for concurrent API calls
- Comprehensive error handling and rate limiting
- Database transactions for data consistency
- Configurable targeting criteria for different search phases

### Security Considerations:
- API keys in environment variables only
- Respectful scraping with delays and robots.txt compliance
- Local data storage (no cloud data leakage)
- LinkedIn ToS compliance with minimal scraping

### Performance Optimization:
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Caching for repeated API calls
- Incremental updates to avoid re-analysis
- Background processing for long-running discovery

This project represents a sophisticated, production-ready system that immediately addresses Rob's core job search challenges while providing a foundation for continued enhancement and automation.
