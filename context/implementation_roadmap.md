    stage VARCHAR(50),
    employees_count INTEGER,
    founded_year INTEGER,
    location VARCHAR(100),
    ai_washing_score INTEGER,
    healthcare_relevance BOOLEAN,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Funding table
CREATE TABLE funding_rounds (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id),
    round_type VARCHAR(50),
    amount_usd BIGINT,
    announced_date DATE,
    investors TEXT[]
);

-- Intelligence table
CREATE TABLE company_intelligence (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id),
    technical_depth_score INTEGER,
    team_quality_score INTEGER,
    market_position TEXT,
