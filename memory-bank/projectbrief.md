# Project Brief - Startup Intelligence System

## Project Name
Startup Intelligence System

## Project Purpose
Build an automated startup discovery and analysis system that enables Rob Ford to find and target authentic AI companies in the Seattle healthcare/B2B ecosystem, shifting time allocation from 80% data crunching to 80% strategic analysis and relationship building.

## Core Problem Statement
Manual startup research is time-consuming and inefficient, making it difficult to identify genuine AI companies among the noise of "AI-washing" companies that merely integrate ChatGPT. Rob needs an automated system to discover, analyze, and prioritize companies where his unique combination of FDA regulatory experience and technical leadership would be most valuable.

## Target User
**Rob Ford** - 20-year tech veteran with expertise in:
- Data science and AI/ML product development
- Healthcare systems and FDA regulatory processes
- Multi-cloud architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Real-time communications and B2B platforms
- Remote/hybrid team leadership

## Success Criteria
1. **Discovery**: 20+ qualified startup targets discovered per week (automated)
2. **Quality**: Filter out 85%+ of AI-washing companies accurately
3. **Analysis**: Enable 5+ deep strategic assessments per week
4. **Efficiency**: Achieve 80% strategic work / 20% data processing split
5. **Outcomes**: Generate 3+ highly personalized applications per week with >15% response rate

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Multi-source Discovery**
   - Y Combinator companies (W22, S22, W23 batches)
   - GeekWire Seattle startup news
   - LinkedIn ML job postings
   - GitHub organization analysis

2. **AI-Washing Detection**
   - Engineering blog technical depth analysis
   - ML engineer team composition assessment
   - GitHub ML contribution scoring
   - Marketing authenticity evaluation

3. **Strategic Analysis**
   - Healthcare relevance scoring
   - Seattle geographic filtering
   - Funding stage optimization (Series A-B)
   - Team size assessment (50-200 employees)

4. **Intelligence Gathering**
   - Company profile generation
   - Competitive landscape mapping
   - Strategic fit scoring
   - Outreach recommendation generation

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Complete daily discovery run in <30 minutes
2. **Scalability**: Support 10,000+ company records
3. **Automation**: Minimal manual intervention required
4. **Accuracy**: 85%+ accuracy in AI-washing detection
5. **Compliance**: Respect API rate limits and robots.txt

## Constraints
1. **Geographic Focus**: Seattle metro area companies
2. **Company Stage**: Series A-B (post-PMF, pre-scale)
3. **Industry Focus**: Healthcare AI, B2B SaaS, real-time communications
4. **Anti-patterns**: No government contracting, no pure consulting roles
5. **Technical**: Must identify real ML/AI vs. API integration plays

## Key Deliverables
1. **Phase 1**: Discovery Engine (COMPLETED)
2. **Phase 2**: AI-Washing Detection (COMPLETED)
3. **Phase 3**: Intelligence Gathering (IN PROGRESS)
4. **Phase 4**: Strategic Analysis Tools (PLANNED)
5. **Phase 5**: Outreach Automation (PLANNED)

## Unique Value Proposition
The system leverages Rob's specific background to target companies where his rare combination of FDA regulatory experience, healthcare systems knowledge, and technical leadership would provide maximum value - particularly healthcare AI startups navigating regulatory complexity.

## Project Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Discovery Engine and AI-Washing Detection (COMPLETED)
- **Week 3-4**: Intelligence Gathering and Analysis Tools
- **Week 5-6**: Outreach Automation and Optimization
- **Ongoing**: Continuous improvement based on response rates and outcomes
