- [ ] Identify top 10 targets
- [ ] Generate first strategic analysis
- [ ] Document any issues or improvements

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **LinkedIn Scraping**: Using mock data due to ToS
2. **Geographic Detection**: ~10% false positive rate
3. **Company Names**: Deduplication misses variants
4. **API Dependencies**: Some features need valid keys

### Technical Debt
1. **Caching**: No persistent cache implemented
2. **Monitoring**: Basic logging only
3. **Backups**: No automated DB backup
4. **Deployment**: Manual process only

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Performance**: Parallel processing could improve speed
2. **Accuracy**: ML models could enhance scoring
3. **Coverage**: Additional data sources available
4. **UI**: Web interface would improve usability

## Evolution of Project Decisions
