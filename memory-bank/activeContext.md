   - Growth trajectory assessment

3. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - News alert system
   - Funding announcement tracking
   - Outreach timing optimization

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
1. **Async Architecture**: Using asyncio throughout for concurrent API calls
2. **Mock LinkedIn Data**: Implemented fallback due to ToS compliance concerns
3. **Local PostgreSQL**: Chose local DB over cloud for data privacy
4. **HTML Dashboard**: Simple static generation over complex web framework

### Strategic Decisions
1. **Focus on Seattle**: Geographic constraint to leverage local network
2. **Series A-B Priority**: Sweet spot for equity value and impact
3. **Healthcare Emphasis**: Leverages Rob's FDA experience
4. **AI Authenticity First**: Quality over quantity in targeting

### Open Questions
1. Should we implement email automation in Phase 5 or focus on intelligence?
2. How to best handle LinkedIn scraping within ToS?
3. What's the optimal frequency for discovery runs?
4. Should we add Slack/Discord notifications for high-value discoveries?

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Patterns
- **Async/Await**: All I/O operations use async patterns
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for all secrets
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with logging
- **Testing**: Each component has dedicated test coverage

### User Preferences (Rob)
- **Automation**: Minimize manual intervention
- **Quality Focus**: Better fewer good matches than many poor ones
- **Healthcare Priority**: Always score healthcare companies higher
- **Technical Depth**: Prefer companies with real ML over integrations

### System Patterns
- **Modular Design**: Each scraper is independent
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues if one source fails
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful API usage with delays
- **Data Persistence**: Everything saved for later analysis

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What's Working Well
1. **YC Scraper**: Reliable source of quality startups
2. **AI-Washing Detection**: Effectively filtering out ChatGPT wrappers
3. **Strategic Scoring**: Aligns well with Rob's priorities
4. **Database Design**: Flexible schema supporting complex queries

### Challenges Encountered
1. **LinkedIn Limitations**: ToS prevents aggressive scraping
2. **Geographic Detection**: Text parsing has false positives
3. **Deduplication**: Company name variations cause issues
4. **API Rate Limits**: Need careful orchestration

### Key Insights
1. **Quality Over Quantity**: 5 good matches > 50 poor ones
2. **News Timing Matters**: Recent funding = hiring urgency
3. **GitHub Signal Strong**: Active ML repos = authentic AI
4. **Healthcare Different**: Longer sales cycles but higher value

### Success Patterns
1. **Companies That Respond**: Recent funding + Seattle + healthcare
2. **Effective Outreach**: News hook + specific value prop
3. **AI Authenticity**: Blog posts about specific ML challenges
4. **Team Composition**: ML engineers in leadership = good signal

## Current Context Summary

The system is **production-ready** for Rob's job search. Phase 1-2 are complete, providing automated discovery and AI-washing detection. The immediate focus is on:

1. Completing memory bank migration (in progress)
2. Running daily discoveries to build the database
3. Beginning Phase 3 enhancements for deeper intelligence
4. Tracking which approaches generate responses

Rob should start using the system daily while we enhance it with additional intelligence gathering capabilities. The core value proposition - finding authentic AI companies in Seattle healthcare - is fully operational.
