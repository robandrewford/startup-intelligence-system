# Product Context - Startup Intelligence System

## Why This Project Exists

### The Real Problem
Rob Ford is not just looking for a job - he's looking for the right strategic opportunity to leverage his unique combination of FDA regulatory experience and technical leadership in the healthcare AI space. The traditional job search process (browsing job boards, mass applications) wastes 80% of time on data gathering rather than strategic relationship building.

### The Hidden Motivation
Rob's ultimate vision is to build a private healthcare exchange that enables collective bargaining by having patients incorporate and negotiate as entities. This job search is about finding the right runway and connections to eventually build this healthcare disruption platform.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. AI-Washing Detection
**Problem**: The market is flooded with companies claiming to be "AI-powered" when they're just using ChatGPT APIs.
**Solution**: Automated 4-factor authenticity scoring based on:
- Engineering blog technical depth
- ML engineer team composition (>20% threshold)
- GitHub ML contributions and custom models
- Marketing content specificity vs. vague claims

### 2. Strategic Targeting
**Problem**: Manually researching companies to find the right fit is time-consuming and inefficient.
**Solution**: Automated discovery and scoring based on:
- Healthcare relevance (leverages FDA experience)
- Seattle location (networking advantage)
- Series A-B stage (meaningful equity)
- Team size 50-200 (leadership opportunity)
- Technical authenticity (no AI-washing)

### 3. Opportunity Identification
**Problem**: Missing timely opportunities due to information overload.
**Solution**: Daily automated discovery from:
- Y Combinator recent batches
- GeekWire funding announcements
- LinkedIn ML job postings
- GitHub active ML organizations
